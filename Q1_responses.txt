Good
I was well prepared and studied so I had no problem
It was more challenging individually
individually I was a lot more anxious since I could not compare my answers with others
Completing the test individually is hard and since most of the class is not biology major there should be a review of like 50 questions and 25 of them will be on the exam. Group work is the best way.
Much more confident in my answers as a group
I thought both the individual and group parts went fine. Most of the questions were simple enough that collaboration did not seem to be very beneficial in the group portion
Individually I often doubted myself, casuing me to get questions wrong
I preferred testing in a group.

Individually required less explaining, but as a group you actually had to work through your reasoning.
Faster as a group because we already did it. One tricky problem was helpful to discuss. They helped me eliminate an answer choice and be more confident in answering it.
Both were good experiences. Though I typically prefer working individually, it is nice to collaborate when I am unsure about something.

While in a group I answered questions more thoroughly than by myself.
I think I was more successful on test in group
I was confident going in and felt like I did a good job on the individual portion of the exam.
It was useful to discuss harder questions.
The test in a group was a little easier because there are multiple brains instead of one, so at least one person is most likely to know the correct answer. The group test is also a lot quicker.
